# Sales-Order-Lifecycle-Vendor-Management-System
This project simulates a high-volume Würth ERP environment, managing a 50,000+ row dataset to track the end-to-end order journey. I developed an automated system to standardize article identification, monitor real-time backorders, and generate vendor follow-up reports, transforming raw sales data into actionable supply chain intelligence.
